The case study on eBay provides a comprehensive analysis of the company's business model, challenges, solutions, growth strategies, and financials. Here's a brief summary of the key points:

**Overview:** eBay revolutionized online shopping by offering a platform for buying and selling a wide range of products. It focused on small businesses and prioritized trust, safety, and community support.

**Real-World Problems:** Before eBay, online marketplaces didn't exist. There were limitations due to geographic boundaries, lack of diverse product offerings, and absence of a reliable feedback system or secure payment methods.

**Solutions:** eBay introduced an innovative online auction system, integrated a reliable payment infrastructure through PayPal, and implemented a feedback system to build trust. This transformed it into a global online marketplace.

**Growth:** eBay's user base grew significantly by connecting buyers and sellers globally and offering tools for sellers. However, from 2015-2023, eBay faced challenges like lack of innovation, tougher competition, and trust issues.

**Financials and Strategy:** eBay's primary revenue sources include transaction fees and marketing services. To sustain growth, eBay focuses on internal management, supply chain improvements, product strategy, and enhancing customer support.

**Future Projections:** The study includes guesstimates on future trends, such as the growth of mobile commerce, the increase in e-commerce platforms, and the expected rise in global e-commerce sales.

**Conclusion:** The case study highlights the importance of continuous innovation and strategic planning to maintain market leadership and address evolving consumer needs. Also offers valuable insights into eBay's business model, emphasizing the significance of adaptability in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.
